                    <div class="disc"><p>PlannerHouse was founded in 2007 as a spin-off from a company that creates state-of-the-art 3D visualizations for the sub-sea oil industry. The same technology that is used to visualize large oil rigs below water was applied to visualize the interior of homes and properties. The vision, which 
                        we stay true to to this day, was that everyone should be able to visualize their home, online.</p></div>
